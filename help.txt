Welcome to SprintBot! You can use SprintBot commands by starting your message with "sb!" (without quotes) or by tagging @SprintBot#8987 in your message. You can also DM SprintBot directly to use these commands by yourself.

The following commands are available:

* sprint X :MM
Schedules a sprint that will last for X minutes and starts when the clock reaches the :MM minute.

* sprint :MM X
Works the same as above, with the input order swapped.

* sprint X
Schedules a sprint of the specified length that will start when the clock reaches a minute divisible by 5 (:00, :05, :10, etc.)

* sprint :MM
Schedules a 15-minute sprint when the clock next reaches the :MM minute.

* cancel sprint
Cancels a sprint that has been scheduled, but hasn't started yet. Note that sprints that have already started can't be canceled, and that only the user who scheduled a sprint or a moderator of a channel can cancel sprints.
